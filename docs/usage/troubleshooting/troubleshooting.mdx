<Tip>
OpenHands only supports Windows via WSL. Please be sure to run all commands inside your WSL terminal.

### Launch docker client failed

**Description**

When running OpenHands, the following error is seen:
```
Launch docker client failed. Please make sure you have installed docker and started docker desktop/daemon.
```

**Resolution**

Try these in order:
* Confirm `docker` is running on your system. You should be able to run `docker ps` in the terminal successfully.
* If using Docker Desktop, ensure `Settings > Advanced > Allow the default Docker socket to be used` is enabled.
* Depending on your configuration you may need `Settings > Resources > Network > Enable host networking` enabled in Docker Desktop.
* Reinstall Docker Desktop.

### Permission Error

**Description**

On initial prompt, an error is seen with `Permission Denied` or `PermissionError`.

**Resolution**

* Check if the `~/.openhands-state` is owned by `root`. If so, you can:
  * Change the directory's ownership: `sudo chown <user>:<user> ~/.openhands-state`.
  * or update permissions on the directory: `sudo chmod 777 ~/.openhands-state`
  * or delete it if you donâ€™t need previous data. OpenHands will recreate it. You'll need to re-enter LLM settings.
* If mounting a local directory, ensure your `WORKSPACE_BASE` has the necessary permissions for the user running
  OpenHands.

### Unable to access VS Code tab via local IP

**Description**

When accessing OpenHands through a non-localhost URL (such as a LAN IP address), the VS Code tab shows a "Forbidden"
error, while other parts of the UI work fine.

**Resolution**

This happens because VS Code runs on a random high port that may not be exposed or accessible from other machines.
To fix this:

1. Set a specific port for VS Code using the `SANDBOX_VSCODE_PORT` environment variable:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
       -e SANDBOX_VSCODE_PORT=41234 \
       -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:latest \
       -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
       -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
       -p 3000:3000 \
       -p 41234:41234 \
       --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
       --name openhands-app \
       docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:latest
   ```
2. Make sure to expose the same port with `-p 41234:41234` in your Docker command.
3. If running with the development workflow, you can set this in your `config.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [sandbox]
   vscode_port = 41234
   ```
### VS Code tab shows cross-origin cookie error

**Description**

When the main app is served over HTTPS but VS Code runs on an HTTP port, the UI displays:

```
The code editor cannot be embedded due to browser security restrictions. Cross-origin cookies are being blocked.
```

**Resolution**

Serve the VS Code server from the same host and protocol as the app:

1. Set a fixed port for VS Code using `SANDBOX_VSCODE_PORT` and expose it.
2. Proxy that port via your web server so `/vscode/` is available under the same domain. Example Nginx block:
   ```nginx
   location /vscode/ {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:41234/;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
   }
   ```
3. Add `vscode_port = 41234` under `[sandbox]` in `config.toml` to match the proxied port.
4. If the configured port is already in use, OpenHands chooses a random
   available port and prints a warning. Update your proxy if you see this.

### Connected repository not shown in VS Code

**Description**

The VS Code tab opens but the cloned repository does not appear in the file explorer.

**Resolution**

1. Verify that the VS Code CLI is available by running `which code` inside the container. If the command is missing, install the CLI tools for your distribution.
2. Make sure your workspace is mounted to `/workspace` in the container. The easiest way is to set `SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/path/to/projects:/workspace:rw` when starting the container. This ensures the cloned repository is visible to VS Code.
3. Check that the repository directory is mounted in the container using `docker inspect <container>` and reviewing the `Mounts` section. The path returned by `get_vscode_folder()` in `openhands/runtime/base.py` must be accessible inside the container.
4. After confirming the mount, reload the editor. The repository folder should now be listed.

### Old projects appear in new conversations

**Description**

Starting a new conversation sometimes shows files from a previous session.

**Resolution**

OpenHands removes old files before cloning the selected repository. If you mount
`/workspace` from the host, ensure the directory is writable by the container
user so the runtime can clean it. After launching a new conversation the runtime
logs a warning if any files could not be deleted. The workspace is cleared on
startup except for `.vscode`, so each new conversation begins with an empty
folder until a repository is cloned or initialized.
